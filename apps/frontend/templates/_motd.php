<h2>Virtual Private Network is...</h2>
<p>
	<strong>Technology which allows you to change IP address and pass internet access limitaions.</strong><br />
	You will be connected to internet through one of our servers, thus hosts you visit will not see your IP.<br />
	Connection between you and us is compressed and encrypted, thus your provider will see only random data.<br />
	This way you can use any resources which may be restricted by your ISP.<br />
	Furthermore, compression will speed things up ;)
